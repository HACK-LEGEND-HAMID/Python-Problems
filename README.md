## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository is a **Python problem-solving lab** built to sharpen **logic**, **thinking speed**, and a **hacker-style mindset**.  
The goal is not just to write code but to **think deeply**, **analyze problems**, and **solve them efficiently** like a real programmer or ethical hacker.

Every **part contains exactly 100 Python problems**.  
Each part includes **mixed challenges** logic-based, real-life scenarios, algorithmic thinking, automation-style problems, and brain-teasing tasks.

> ⚠️ *This is not copy-paste learning.  
> This is think → break → rebuild → master.*
